discuss: is 36 keys still too many?

## Mission Briefing

By the time I'm done with this particular rabbit hole, I will, with this repo's help:

1. Understand my shiny new 36-key corne
2. Be able to see the keymap
3. Confidently change the keymap!

### Optional things that sound fun (here, now, at the start of the project)

- roll a home-made <https://layout.new> for my darling
- Find out more about the little LCD on the side
