## Setting up the environment (Manjaro)

amazing that windows/mac people get a gui and nerds like me dont get a choice :'(
oh well

```fish
yay -S --needed --noconfirm git python-pip libffi
```

```fish
yay -S qmk-git
```

```fish
qmk setup
```

returns

```fish
→ qmk setup
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/qmk", line 5, in <module>
    from qmk_cli.script_qmk import main
  File "/usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages/qmk_cli/script_qmk.py", line 18, in <module>
    milc.cli.milc_options(version=__version__)
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'MILC' object has no attribute 'milc_options'
```

ok rude?

`yay -Rs qmk-git`, `yay -S qmk`?

```fish
❯ qmk setup
☒ Could not find qmk_firmware!
Would you like to clone qmk/qmk_firmware to /home/daydream/qmk_firmware? [y/n]
```

uh nah?

`→ qmk setup -H ./qmk`

`Would you like to clone qmk/qmk_firmware to qmk? [y/n] y
Cloning into 'qmk'...`

awesome, thats qmk like [../qmk/](../qmk/)

wait. thats a clone. nuh uh i need it to be a submodule (BLEH)

lets let it clone anyway and--

`qmk doctor` is complaining about missing udev rules. ok ok give me a sec

`git submodule add https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git`
