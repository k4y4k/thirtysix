## Setting up the environment (Manjaro)

amazing that windows/mac people get a gui and nerds like me dont get a choice :'(
oh well

```fish
yay -S --needed --noconfirm git python-pip libffi
```

```fish
yay -S qmk-git
```

```fish
qmk setup
```

returns

```fish
→ qmk setup
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/qmk", line 5, in <module>
    from qmk_cli.script_qmk import main
  File "/usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages/qmk_cli/script_qmk.py", line 18, in <module>
    milc.cli.milc_options(version=__version__)
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'MILC' object has no attribute 'milc_options'
```

ok rude?

`yay -Rs qmk-git`, `yay -S qmk`?

```fish
❯ qmk setup
☒ Could not find qmk_firmware!
Would you like to clone qmk/qmk_firmware to /home/daydream/qmk_firmware? [y/n]
```

uh nah?

`→ qmk setup -H ./qmk`

`Would you like to clone qmk/qmk_firmware to qmk? [y/n] y
Cloning into 'qmk'...`

awesome, thats qmk like [../qmk/](../qmk/)

wait. thats a clone. nuh uh i need it to be a submodule (BLEH)

The docs say:

> Now that your QMK build environment is set up, you can build a firmware for your keyboard. Start by trying to build the keyboard's default keymap. You should be able to do that with a command in this format:

```fish
qmk compile -kb <keyboard> -km default
```

> For example, to build a firmware for a Clueboard 66% you would use:
> sh

```fish
qmk compile -kb clueboard/66/rev3 -km default
```

HUH?? what do you _mean_? what are you _saying_?!?!
