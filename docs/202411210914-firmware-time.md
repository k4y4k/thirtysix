the docs recommend setting defaults so i dont have to specify crkbd every time. id rather keep this explicit.

```sh
→ qmk new-keymap -kb crkbd
Ψ Generating a new keymap


Name Your Keymap

Your GitHub Username?  [kayak] k4y4k
Ψ Created a new keymap called k4y4k in: /home/daydream/source/thirtysix/qmk_firmware/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/k4y4k.
Ψ Compile a firmware with your new keymap by typing: qmk compile -kb crkbd/rev1 -km k4y4k.
```

ok? lets give it a go

```sh
→ qmk compile -kb crkbd/rev1 -km k4y4k

before i work that out can i get a firmware that actually gives me only the keys i have irl?
